# Road to x86 Assembly

This repo contains experiments I'm going to try out to learn x86 assembly

> *x86 has way too many instructions*

The assembler I will be using is **GAS**

## Experiments

- **Exp-1:** Hello World
  + This contains both NASM and GAS
- **Exp-2:** Looping
- **Exp-3:** Return value of the program can be set by **eax**
- **Exp-4:** Printing Floats
